## The Problem
To Increase Transparency and Prevent Fraudulent Activities that arise on crowd funding plateforms such as **Kickstarter**. 

In some cases, startups turn up as scams and produce nothing leaving investors with empty hands and no way to get their money back.    
There is no guarantee that people who post projects on Kickstarter will deliver on their projects, use the money to implement their projects, or that the completed projects will meet backers' expectations.


## What We Propose
- Smart Contracts to Enforce Funding Terms: There are several ways in which blockchain-enabled smart contracts could provide greater accountability in crowdfunding.
- Making transaction histories more transparent and secure through the use of blockchain technology. Because Blockchain is a type of distributed ledger, all network participants share the same documentation as opposed to individual copies.
- Contributors can decide Where to invest and can Acknowledge the requests for money made by the Project Creators through their votes.The creator can only use the money if a minimum number of contributors approve a certain request.
- This would prevent large sums of money from being squandered by those who are either ill-intended or not qualified to be running a crowdfunding campaign in the first place
- A mockup of [KickStarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/) built using smart contracts written in solidity. The app is built using Reactjs with the help of Nextjs.
### Technology Stack
* ReactJs
* Solidity
* Ethereum Smart Contract

## Features
#### Secure Investment
Information is stored across a network of computers instead of on a single server, makes it very difficult for hackers to compromise the transaction data.
#### Voting Power for Investors
The creator can only use the money if a minimum number of contributors approve a certain request. It will make sure the money is used for Necessities rather than Luxuries.
#### Profit Distribution
The owner of the startup is required to periodically enter details about revenue generation. Any profit that is generated is automatically distributed  among the investors providing investors with additional layer of security of interests of investors.
